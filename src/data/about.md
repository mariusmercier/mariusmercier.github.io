# Hello ! 

I'm a PhD student in Social Psychology at the [Ecole Normale Sup√©rieure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89cole_normale_sup%C3%A9rieure_(Paris)), part of [Paris Sciences & Letters (PSL) University](https://psl.eu/en/university/psl-international-rankings). I am working under the supervision of [Hugo Mercier](https://sites.google.com/site/hugomercier/) in the [evolution and social cognition team](https://esc.dec.ens.fr/fr).

  
During my MPhil in Cognitive Science, I have worked on **insight** and its link to personality and cultural consumption which resulted in two articles (see: [Publications](/personal-site/publications)). 

  
Now, I am working on the dynamics of impression formation with a computational approach. Specifically, I am interested in how people update their judgment about the **competence** of others when presented with new (noisy) evidence. Does it follow optimal Bayesian rules? How do first impressions (mostly non-verbal cues) interact with behavioral and verbal cues?
